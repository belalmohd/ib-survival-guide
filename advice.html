                            <li>When things start to feel overwhelming or stressful, feel free to talk to others — you’re not in this alone.</li>
                            <li>Reflect weekly on what you have achieved: What worked for you? What stressed you out? How can this be fixed?</li>

                                <b>Math (Group 5):</b> Understand the concept first, then apply it. Use YouTube channels or textbooks, then practice with past papers.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>English/Language and Literature (Group 1):</b> Master written analysis for Papers 1 and 2 by writing essays and analyzing texts. Pair this with reading your school’s novels.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Science:</b> Focus on understanding concepts, not just memorizing. Watch channels like Sirus Revision, and practice with SaveMyExams or past papers. IB exams are based on understanding and critical thinking.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Business, Econ, History (Group 3):</b> Aim for deep understanding. For Business, grasp theories and vocabulary, then apply them in case studies or past papers.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Language SL or ab initio (Group 2):</b> Immerse yourself in the language—listen to podcasts, watch shows, and use the language as if traveling. The more you use it, the more comfortable you’ll become.
                            </li>

                            The IB subject guide is perhaps the most underrated tool in your entire IB journey. Think of it as the official blueprint of what the examiners expect you to know — nothing more, nothing less.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Reading the subject guide before starting a topic gives you a clear map of where you’re headed. For example, in Physics, it tells you the exact equations you’re expected to use; in English, it outlines the assessment criteria; in Business, it specifies vocabulary and concepts that will appear on the exam.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Use it like a checklist: learn each point, practice it, then tick it off. Pair it with past paper questions to ensure you’re applying exactly what’s required.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Remember, IB exams are written from these guides, so mastering them means you’re already a step ahead.
